Modification History
This modification document is to help me see how progress continues throughout the program.

Date	   	Details	
07.06.17	Made github readMe file and drafted ideas for classes
07.07.17	Created a main.cpp, player.cpp, and player.h
07.08.17	Created gameBoard.cpp and gameBoard.h to hold a temporary board-the first 1-12 squares of a completed gameboard.
07.09.17	CommunityChanceClass
		Decided this class should be separated and the cards should be declared inside the class and called in main.
07.10.17	CommunityCards Class
		Trying to figure out how to store contents of the card as well as how much they add/subtract in money in one place such
		as array and vector. Then I want to make this array or vector in Community Class but call and mess with it in main.
07.11.17	CommunityCards Class
		Working on how to initialize vector or array of objects in a class then call it in main.
07.12.17	gameBoard Class, player Class, and main.cpp
		Rewrote initialization of gameBoard and player objects in main to be vectors and to be done in functions. Added these
		functions in main.cpp for calling. Lastly I wrote a dice function in main.
07.13.17	CommunityCards.h, CommunityCards.cpp
		Wrote community card header/cpp file and initialized cards to use later
07.14.17	Player classes, gameBoard classes, main.cpp
		Added functionality to keep track of which squares are owned and which player specifically owns the square landed on.
07.15.17	Player.h, player.cpp, main.cpp
		Added makeMove function in main to loop through the game board depending how much player roll was. Added variable to 
		player class to determine playerâ€™s position on board.

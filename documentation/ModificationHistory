Modification History
This modification document is to help me see how progress continues throughout the program.

Date	   	Details	
07.06.17	Made github readMe file and drafted ideas for classes
07.07.17	Created a main.cpp, player.cpp, and player.h
07.08.17	Created gameBoard.cpp and gameBoard.h to hold a temporary board-the first 1-12 squares of a completed gameboard.
07.09.17	CommunityChanceClass
		Decided this class should be separated and the cards should be declared inside the class and called in main.
07.10.17	CommunityCards Class
		Trying to figure out how to store contents of the card as well as how much they add/subtract in money in one place such
		as array and vector. Then I want to make this array or vector in Community Class but call and mess with it in main.
07.11.17	CommunityCards Class
		Working on how to initialize vector or array of objects in a class then call it in main.
07.12.17	gameBoard Class, player Class, and main.cpp
		Rewrote initialization of gameBoard and player objects in main to be vectors and to be done in functions. Added these
		functions in main.cpp for calling. Lastly I wrote a dice function in main.
07.13.17	CommunityCards.h, CommunityCards.cpp
		Wrote community card header/cpp file and initialized cards to use later
07.14.17	Player classes, gameBoard classes, main.cpp
		Added functionality to keep track of which squares are owned and which player specifically owns the square landed on.
07.15.17	Player.h, player.cpp, main.cpp
		Added makeMove function in main to loop through the game board depending how much player roll was. Added variable to 
		player class to determine player’s position on board.
07.19.17	Player and board class
		Researching how to initialize these outside of main.
07.21.17	Classes
		Restructuring everything to have most functions outside of main.cpp.
07.23.17	checkMonopoly function
		Rewrote part of this function to return true or false when player has a monopoly
07.24.17	otherSpaces function
		Created otherSpaces function to deal with spaces that are no properties or are dealt with uniquely
		(community chest, income tax, chance, railroads, & utilities)
07.24.17	otherSpaces function, pickCommunityChestCard, pickChanceCard, and makeChanceCards
		Worked on making otherSpaces function more clean, made pickCommunityChestCard to randomly pick a card for player
		subtract or add money accordingly as well as pickChanceCard which does the same. Created makeChanceCards to
		initialize chance cards.
07.25.17	pickCommunityCard, communityCard struct, makeMove function, main.cpp
		Added functionality to move players to different position if community card calls for it.
		Added new variable to communityCard struct for playerPosition movement.
		Added code to makeMove function to give player $200 every time they pass or land on go.
		Added calls to pauseTime function to give new feel before/after and in between player turns.
		Player’s move are also now displayed during their turn with 1 second pause while they move throughout the board.
07.26.17	jailRoll and checkJailStatus function
		Created two functions. jailRoll to roll the dice for doubles and checkJailStatus to ask players to either pay or roll
		to get out of jail. Main.cpp is now also in an if statement to see if player isn’t in jail before playing the game.
07.27.17	jailRoll, pickCommunityCard
		Deleted jailRoll function and just ran “%2=0” with diceRoll() value.
		Added functionality for Community Chest Cards that say you get paid from multiple players.
07.28.17	Get Out of Jail Free Card, Community Chest Cards, Chance Cards
		Added functionality for Get Out of Jail Free Card player can now hold as well as use it if they are in jail
		(will be able to trade in the future).
		Made all Community Cards available to draw except one that asks to pay repairs for every house or hotel you own until I
		am able to add build house/hotel functionality.
		Moved Community Chest Card functions into a CommunityCards.cpp for better organization.
		Moved Chance Card functions into chanceCards.cpp for better organization.
08.01.17	pickCommunityCard
		Trying to change the portion of pickCommunityCard function to reset position of the player to actually show the player
		moving using makeMove function.
08.06.17	Property struct
		Added a bool variable “monopoly” to each property which will change to true once property is part of a monopoly.
		Changed past variable monopoly to “monopolyGroup” to determine which spaces are grouped together.
08.13.17	propertyBuild function, end of turn options
		Started work on propertyBuild function to show user which properties they own a monopoly on and allow them to select a
		monopoly to build on.
		Added options at end of player’s turn to show their properties, monopolies, and or call the propertyBuild function.
08.29.17	propertyBuild function
		Continued work on propertyBuild function. Displays to user which properties they own in a monopoly and asks them which
		group they’d like to build on.
